# Modules
Playing lego is fun, simple and effective!

When submitting your code to the modules application, please consider the following:

The code or function that you have created shall be generic and modular.
This means that the function(or whatever) must not know any of its inputs. It must work in it's own vaccum and not touch anything in it's sourroundings.

Have this in mind, and we can reuse your code to other projects. In the end, we should only be coding application-specific functionality. And be "building lego" for the most common functionalties.
